- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I felt like the inheritance is really useful when they can reuse a part of the code over and over again. For me, I was trying really hard at first to write one of the class as I forget to include the parent's class parameters. And then I fixed it by looking at other example of inheritence.
